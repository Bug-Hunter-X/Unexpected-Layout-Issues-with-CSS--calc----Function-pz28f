The issue is resolved by ensuring consistent unit usage within the `calc()` function. For example, if you're subtracting pixels from a percentage, make sure to use pixels for both values. Using consistent units will ensure that `calc()` operates predictably.  Also, consider the context where `calc()` is used. If it's nested within other percentage-based units, its behavior will depend on how those parent elements are sized.
